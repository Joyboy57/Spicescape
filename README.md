## How Spicescape Works ‚öôÔ∏è  
Spicescape uses advanced algorithms to deliver accurate, real-time recommendations and mapping services:

## Core Algorithms and Formulas ‚öôÔ∏è

### 1. Haversine Formula üåç  
The Haversine formula calculates the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere, enabling accurate proximity filtering for food stalls.

**Formula:**  
```markdown
$$
d = 2r \cdot \arcsin\left(\sqrt{\sin^2\left(\frac{\phi_2 - \phi_1}{2}\right) + \cos(\phi_1) \cdot \cos(\phi_2) \cdot \sin^2\left(\frac{\lambda_2 - \lambda_1}{2}\right)}\right)
$$
```

- \( d \): Distance between two points (in kilometers or miles)  
- \( r \): Radius of the Earth (approx. **6371 km**)  
- \( \phi_1, \phi_2 \): Latitudes of the two points (in radians)  
- \( \lambda_1, \lambda_2 \): Longitudes of the two points (in radians)  

**Use Case in Spicescape:**  
This formula helps in filtering nearby food stalls based on user location.

---

### 2. Bounding Box Filtering üì¶  
Bounding box filtering is used to create a rectangular geographic area for quick search results by minimizing the Haversine calculations.

**Formulas:**  
For the **minimum and maximum latitude**:  
```markdown
$$
\text{min\_lat} = \phi - \frac{\text{radius}}{r}
$$
$$
\text{max\_lat} = \phi + \frac{\text{radius}}{r}
$$
```

For the **minimum and maximum longitude**:  
```markdown
$$
\text{min\_lon} = \lambda - \arcsin\left(\frac{\text{radius}}{r \cdot \cos(\phi)}\right)
$$
$$
\text{max\_lon} = \lambda + \arcsin\left(\frac{\text{radius}}{r \cdot \cos(\phi)}\right)
$$
```

- \( \phi, \lambda \): Latitude and longitude of the center point (in radians)  
- \( \text{radius} \): Search radius (in kilometers or miles)  
- \( r \): Radius of the Earth (approx. **6371 km**)  

**Use Case in Spicescape:**  
Bounding box filtering narrows down the search area before applying precise calculations like Haversine.

### 3. Tokenization (Text Preprocessing for Search) ‚úÇÔ∏è  
Tokenization breaks text input (e.g., food stall names or reviews) into smaller components for better search and NLP processing.

**Tokenization Process:**  
1. Convert text to lowercase:  
   ```python
   input_text.lower()
   ```
2. Remove punctuation:  
   ```python
   re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', input_text)
   ```
3. Split text into tokens:  
   ```python
   tokens = input_text.split()
   ```

**Example:**  
For input `‚ÄúBest hot dogs in town!‚Äù`:
- **Step 1:** Convert to lowercase: `"best hot dogs in town"`  
- **Step 2:** Remove punctuation: `"best hot dogs in town"`  
- **Step 3:** Split into tokens: `["best", "hot", "dogs", "in", "town"]`  

**Use Case in Spicescape:**  
Tokenization is used in search functionalities, enabling fast and accurate food stall lookups based on keywords or reviews.

---

## Example Integrations üîó  

- **Haversine Distance:** Quickly find nearby food stalls using precise distance calculations.  
- **Bounding Box Filtering:** Narrow down search areas to improve performance for large datasets.  
- **Tokenization:** Enhance search accuracy for queries like `"best biryani near me."`

---

## **Crowdsourced Data Aggregation**  
Users contribute directly to Spicescape by submitting stall details, reviews, and photos. These are processed using a blend of **natural language processing (NLP)** and **sentiment analysis** to provide meaningful recommendations.
